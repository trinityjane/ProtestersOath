I have fixed the login and update a number of small features:
1. The barcode screen draws as conceived.
2. All print statements have been removed
3. Remove +1 off of phone numbers if it is present.
4. Back buttons and icons have been reworked.
5. Fixed the signing cert so that iOS users can download.
